## Description
Provide a virtual ukulele for click-and-write functionality which allows user to efficiently write tabs without having to turn to a physical ukulele to get the fret position for each note. Can also change tunings of the ukulele to allow different types of ukulele sound (low G, high G, baritone, etc).

## Future improvements
play tab functionality, load txt file into tab, improve sound quality

## Motivation
I play ukulele and sometimes like to compose tabs after playing by ears. But, typing each ''''-'''' and making sure all lines are aligned are annoying. So I wanted an app with shortcuts to make life easier. 

## Lessons
